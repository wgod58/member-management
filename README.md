### Unit test coverage report

```sh

### Deployment CI/CD

member management deploys using `Google Cloud Build` CICD
And it deploy to Google Kubernetes Engine automatically.

- ##### Cloud Build

  - **How do you update your docker image for deployment ?**

    - A cloud build trigger is set up for repo

      - when develop branch update, the `cloudbuild.yaml` script will be executed by Google Cloud Build automatically and a new docker image will be built and save inside `Container Registry`

      - Once the docker image is updated. Cloud Build will execute the remaining commands inside `cloudbuild.yaml` in which the latest docker image will be deployed to `Google Kubernetes Engine` as a running service.

      - To sum up, developers do not need to worry about deployment.

      - For more information about Cloud Build please view the Google GCloud Platform Documentation
